                <p>Mikasa was born to an Eldian father and an Asian mother, the former also being an Ackerman.[28] Before her parents' death, she lived peacefully with them in the farmlands of Wall Maria. Mikasa underwent a painful scarring ritual from her
                    mother, who cut into her skin the mark of their family.[29] Being the last of their race made them high value targets to robbers, who killed Mikasa's parents and attempted to kidnap her for the purpose of selling her as a slave to
                    the people in the Capital when she was only nine years old.[28]</p>
                <p>She was rescued by Eren, who tricked and killed two of the slavers. He was then overwhelmed by the third trafficker and was on the verge of being strangled. Desperately, Eren urged Mikasa to fight to win. Although she was initially frightened,
                    she came to realize that "this world is a callous and merciless place," dispatching the robber who was trying to kill Eren. When Eren's father arrived with members of the Military Police Brigade, she was given the scarf by Eren and
                    accepted into his family. This event awakened the fighting instincts and perfect self-control that runs in the Ackerman family, that would later turn her into a formidable soldier.[30] She then went to live with Eren's family until
                    the Fall of Wall Maria.[31]</p>

                <p>Levi is the son of Kuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in the Underground and was made pregnant by one of her clients. One day, Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was dead.[21]
                    There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed. In a rare showing of compassion, Kenny decided to take care of him. He raised Levi as well as he could: teaching him knife skills, how to get along with
                    people, and violent behavior. Levi also learned to use his own inner power that he possessed as a member of the Ackerman family.[22] Time passed and eventually, Kenny taught Levi everything he knew. However, he did not consider himself
                    as a good father figure. [23][24] One day, in the subterranean city, Levi started a fight which he won easily. At that moment, Kenny decided to leave him behind, satisfied that he had taught Levi the skills he needed to survive.[25]
                    Later, he became a notorious thug in the underground, but eventually left the place to join the Survey Corps.[3] Although he was at odds with Erwin,[26] he ended up becoming one of his most trusted men.</p>
